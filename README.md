# uScopeControl

Microscopes have morphed from purely optical instruments into motorized, robotic machines that form images on digital sensors rather than eyeballs. Development of new microscopes most often depends on concurrent software development to bring these custom-build systems to life. This dependence on software brings opportunities and challenges. To start to address these challenges by identifying common problems and shared solutions, we assembled a small group of researchers that develop or use software to control their custom-build microscopes at the Janelia Research Campus for a two day workshop in February 2020. The outcome of the workshop was the definition of clear milestones, as well as the recognition of an involved community, much larger than the one assembled at the workshop. The White Paper summarizes the major issues identified, proposes approaches to address these as a community, and outlines the next steps that can be taken to develop a framework facilitating shared microscope software development, significantly speeding up development of new microscopy systems.
