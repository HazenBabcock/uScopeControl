# uScopeControl

Microscopes have morphed from purely optical instruments into motorized, robotic machines that form images on digital sensors rather than eyeballs. This continuing trend towards automation and digitization enables many new approaches to microscopy that would have been impossible or impractical without computer interfaces.  Accordingly, todayâ€™s development of new microscopes most often depends on concurrent software development to bring these custom-build systems to life. This dependence on software brings opportunities and challenges. Most importantly, a key challenge while developing new microscopes is to develop the appropriate software. Despite the fact that software is easily copied and distributed, remarkably few opportunities are available to share experiences creating microscope control software. In turn, this brings challenges in creating maintainable and flexible software code and writing User Interfaces (UIs) that are easily used by researchers, who are primarily life scientists.   

To start to address these challenges by identifying common problems and shared solutions, we assembled a small group of researchers that develop or use software to control their custom-build microscopes at the Janelia Research Campus for a two day workshop in February 2020.  The outcome of the workshop was the definition of clear milestones, as well as the recognition of an involved community, much larger than the one assembled at the workshop. This community encounters similar hurdles and shares a great desire to overcome these by stronger, community-wide collaborations on Open Source Software.  This White Paper summarizes the major issues identified, proposes approaches to address these as a community, and outlines the next steps that can be taken to develop a framework facilitating shared microscope software development, significantly speeding up development of new microscopy systems.
